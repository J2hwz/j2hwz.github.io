                        Examining Structural and Semantic Predictors of Announced Sarcasm on r/AskReddit

                            We investigated the prevalence of both prosidic-mimicking [e.g. :) :/ :O or amaaaaaazing] and semantic markers in sarcastic comments on Reddit. 
                            We found that a host of cues which mimic prosody, and other aspects of figures of speech, were inconsistent predictors of announced sarcasm. 
                            In contrast, when talking about sociomoral topics such as politics or race, users were more likely to tag their comments with "/s". 
                            This suggests that users are more likely to announce sarcasm in text-based conversations where misinterpretation would be socially detrimental.
                            This project began its life as my undergraduate coursework for Zachary Horne's course Big Data and Psychological Science.

                            This project investigates the factors that influence our consensus judgements given different evidence, whether that be amount of agreement, source of testimony, or topic of discussion. 
                            A key aim of this project is to improve our understanding of how to communicate scientific findings on pressing issues such as climate change. 
                            As such, I will run an experimental study and create a series of research-backed short video essays/animations to increase awareness on these topics.
